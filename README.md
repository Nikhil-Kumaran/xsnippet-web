XSnippet Web
============

XSnippet is a simple web-service for sharing code snippets on the Internet.
XSnippet Web is a single page application (SPA) for the XSnippet API service.

Years ago it was started as educational project, and nothing changed since
then. That's why the fourth reincarnation is written in JavaScript using
React, Redux, Webpack and other modern technologies.
